## Documentation

A selection of documentation and specifications relevent to 4chord MIDI.

The original locations are linked within the firmware code, e.g. [`usb.h`](../firmware/usb.h). However, those locations have changed in the past, and old links resulted in 404 or redirects. To make everyone's life easier in case it happens again at some point in the future, I just added their copies here.
